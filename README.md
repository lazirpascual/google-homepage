# Google Homepage

This is a project that replicates the front-end design of the google.ca homepage. It uses HTML and CSS to structure, style, and design the project as close to the 
real google homepage as possible.


From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css).
